## Go board - A board helping learning Go by examples

How to use: open file go.html with you browser.

This is a board which you can:
- place and remove pieces (change this mode by press button 2)
- change color of next placing pieces (press button 1)
- change the changing color mode (keep old color as the color for next pieces or change the color sequentially - by press space bar)
- undo placing pieces (press button j)
- clear the board (by press button backspace*)

But first you must focus (click) on the board to make these button pressing take effect (currently I don't know how to auto focus on the canvas when the page finish loading :()

(* there still an error here: when you place some pieces and clear the board, there is an circle still appear in the board. I don't know how to fix this bug, if you know please tell me, thank you very much :D)
